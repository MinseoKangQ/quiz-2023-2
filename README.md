## 1. Project outline

&nbsp; 
In the second semester of 2023, at the club fair, piece of stars decided to prepare content related to stars and celestial bodies. Although it is possible to use a platform such as netlify to construct a static page or make it easier to participate in quizzes and create lists by hand, we judged that these methods may be accompanied by various inconveniences.
<br>
&nbsp; So we decided to make the event more effective by creating and distributing our own web page. This webpage will contain celestial body-related quiz questions and information about the piece of stars, and is designed so that anyone interested in star sculpture can participate in the quiz and check the results through this page. In addition, we decided to implement a function that would allow you to apply for participation online without the hassle of creating a list by hand.
<br>
&nbsp; By doing this, we were able to provide a convenient environment for participants and at the same time provide an opportunity to run the event smoothly.
